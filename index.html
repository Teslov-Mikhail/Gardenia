        <h3>How to manage a garden on another planet</h3>
        <h5>A guide for future colonists</h5>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
          Hello! Thanks for picking up my book. I'll try to guide you step by step <br>
          in how to manage your own garden to make your colony completely self-sufficient!
        </p>
        <h4>Ground preparation</h4>
        <img src="gfx/help/soil.png" alt="Soil types">
        <p>
          Well tilled soil is a must to make sure your plants will grow fast and big thanks to <br>
          easier access to deeper, higher quality soil.
        </p>
        <p>
          After preparing the ground with tilling tool of your choice, it's highly advised to <br>
          put crops in your new farming spot. Support will help your plants grow and it'll make <br>
          breeding easier and more managable for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two types of crops. <br>
          Regular one that can be used for planting and as ground for natural spreading and crosscrops <br>
          used for breeding.
        </p>
        <h4>Spreading</h4>
        <img src="gfx/help/spreading.png" alt="Spreading">
        <p>
          Every plant can spread around in a shape of "+" as long as there's tilled and cropped ground available. <br>
          New plant will be exact clone of its parent.
        </p>
        <h4>Breeding</h4>
        <img src="gfx/help/breeding.png" alt="Breeding">
        <p>
          By planting two plants of any type with crosscrop in the middle there's a chance for you to get a new, <br>
          mutated plant in the place of crosscrop. Child of two different parents will have it's statistics in the middle <br>
          with slight variations. This mechanic can be used to make your plants bigger, more nourishing and in the end, <br>
          make them evolve into completely new species!
        </p>
        <h4>Additional information about plants</h4>
        <p>
          How much you get from a plants depends on it's size, it's root size and it's nutrition. Keep that in mind while breeding new types.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speed of growth depends on plant's size and moisture absorbtion. Small plants with huge absorbtion grow the fastest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spreading is a chance for your plant to mutate or spread to nearby tiles every hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order for your plant to produce food on picking up it must be in it's fully grown state. <br>
          It's also true for both breeding and spreading.
        </p>
        <h4>Compost</h4>
        <img src="gfx/help/compost.png" alt="Compost">
        <p>
          You can drop seed you don't need anymore here to get rid of them.
        </p>
        <h4>Team Management, Food and Actions</h4>
        <img src="gfx/help/team.png" alt="Team">
        <p>
          Gardening is a hard job, and it's intergalactic edition is even harder. It may be helpful to get your friends to work. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Every healthy team member will grant you one additional action per turn. <br>
          Keep them filled and happy to make sure you won't lose your precious action points.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every team member needs one unit of food every 8 hours to keep working. <br>
          In case you've forgotten, our specie cannot die from starvation thanks to our hibernation mechanism. <br>
          So if your friend seems dead, you put a nice veggie in front of their face to put them on their feet.
