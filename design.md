## Gardenia
#### Story
You, the player, are captain of a crew responsible for finding a new home for your
planet-bound civilization. Your colonization ship is extremely primitive and is only

> "Primitive", what kind of primitive, as they don't know much about the things they'd have to do in the quest, or perhaps primitive like homo erectus? ~ Maciej
>> Primitive as-in capable of interstellar travel via cryogenics and thousands of years in flight, not wormhole-tearing 15 minutes adventure ~ Михаил

capable of one-way journey.

As you arrive in the atmosphere of your assigned planet, solar systems away from home
ship fails the landing procedure and you crash on the surface.

> Maybe add something as a little future that there was a special compartement or system that made you survive as the only one from the crew? (Said more about crew in "How to make game engaging") ~ Maciej
>> Everyone is frozen in secured pods, surviving as the only one would pretty much destroy the goal of the mission ~ Михаил
>>> Can it be said that the game could be a little like turn based maybe? A bit like it works in "Divinity: Original Sin II"? I think it could make a nice little thing for plants like turn based growing and such, and how many turns do you want to sleep, etc. ~ Maciej
>>>> Yeah, kind of. I want to use sleeping as turn skip. ~ Михаил

With powerful terraforming tools destroyed, you must use individual abilities of Your
crew members and use planets arid but habitable climate to create new home by yourselves.

> If the plant's arid, then it means no trees of sorts (home lul), gotta use stone and whatever he (main character) finds on the ship in order to make everything work. He must have some kind of little lab or something that survived the crash in order to modify genetically the plants he's going to plant and change. ~ Maciej
>> Even arid zones have a little plant-life ~ Михаил
>>> Yeah, I get that, but it's really little and small variaty. As arid zones are really windy it could be really difficult to plant some plants so as for builidings there needs to be some kind of wind protection AND sun protection as there is no leafy plants in arid zones due to high UV, and they are I believe highly needed in order to make it work as a normal planet and change the climate a bit. Also need to do something about the ground itself, it's is so hot (or cold) in arid climates that it's impossible for plants to grow, because the soil is so dry and the water just evaporates from heat or the wind takes the moisture away. Also the water doesn't moisture the soil, instead it just floats on top, so to keep it realistic there'd need to be a like dig a bit in the soil to get some more moist one from the deep and then get like planters of sorts that would keep the water and soil next to each other so the water is constantly moist. Also, where is the water from, no real rains in arid climates, so if it rains it needs to be really important for the player to do the most of it to keep it AND NOT FLOOD. ~ Maciej
>>>> We can use suspension of disbelief in here. It's an alien planet with plants that somehow thrive in current situation. Problem is with making them thrive better and make the usable. That's why there's that example of weird evergreen weeds. Extremely long roots? Ability to capture moisture straight from the air? It's xenobotany, nobody knows for sure. ~ Михаил
>>>>> Actually capturing moisture from the air would be useful as it travels by wind that takes it away from the ground. Just gotta make that plant that actually does that. As for thinking of xenobotany, maybe a weird kind of plant that actually benefits more from sun than water itself? ALSO parasitic plants? That could be interesting, of course they would slowly destroy the plant they're on, but you could find a way to move them from plant to plant, or even put one parasitic plant on several plants at the same time in order to slow down the killing process, or even get rid of it because they can sustain themselves and the parasite that's living on them. Also idea that for the water part, maybe the ship has a container with limited source of water that help you begin, but you have to be careful, because rains are rare and there's only small amounts of rare groundwaters. ~ Maciej

#### Gameplay

Story is mainly used for tutorial purposes and doesn't really put much into the game itself.
Player is tasked with breeding and mutating more and more new types of plants using few "starting"
crops available in the crash zone.

> Sounds good, just gotta make it in what is it gonna be, gotta think of food and materials for food/shelter (there's the crashed ship, but I doubt anyone would want to live in that for the rest of their lives) ~ Maciej

*Example: Weeds are green, which means they get water from somewhere,
breeding them with weird, dry grass thing will give you grass more capable of handling the temperature.
You can later use that grass to develop edible crops.*

Time can be skipped by resting in the ship to reduce "waiting".

All plants will have "traits" that'll work as hints for breeding puzzles.
> The traits to make it better to understand what to mix with what in order to create something else sounds great. Mixing up! ~ Maciej

**IMPORTANT: How to make game engaging?**

Alien fauna attacks with growing difficulty to force player to defrost colonists as defense force?

> Explain the concept of having a team if You're going to have plants going and can skip time when resting at the ship, does that mean the whole crew has to go to sleep in order to skip time? Why not just make it one character which has to make it work on his own? And find life or something (OR the life comes him later on as a new crashed spaceship as an event)
That would force player to think strategically about what to grow, what to mutate etc. ~ Maciej
>> Setting people on guard posts for the night, then getting defense results in the morning,
skipping night is basically clicking on a ship. ~ Михаил
>>> Is there going to be any form of fatigue? ~ Maciej
>>>> Probably. That can be used for balancing. Sleep deprived guards versus defrosting new ones but upping the cost in food. Making people weaker from lack of food or lack of sleep? Surviving this night for sure or taking your chances but saving more resources? ~ Михаил
>>>>> As animals in arid climates are more of nocturnal types, there could be like sensors or such that the player can make in order to keep them away, also building. Choosing who sleeps at what time, also sleeps slows down hunger and thirst. ~ Maciej

**IMPORTANT: Should the player be able to fail?**

If yes, then auto-save system after every night is a must. With ability to choose which day to go back to
in case something went wrong earlier.

> Good enough I'd say. If we doing food, then it needs to be able to fail/die. Or the fail could be when You completely destroy the planet by accident making it completely unhabitable. ~ Maciej

**IMPORTANT: Is the a quota to meet?**

What's the real goal? Making a sustainable colony?
Should I show progress bars for certain needs?
- Food?
- Clothes?
- Building materials ( wooden buildings )?
- Starch for 3D printing ( tech stuff )?
- Power? Rapeseed?
Meeting certain tiered needs may unlock next tiers and new possibilities.

> Maybe just make it like a sandbox of sorts? Just the main focus as making the planet you're on fully habitable and "Like Earth", creating more lifes, animals even. ~ Maciej
>> After some research about arid climates, there are animals of sorts in those climates, I think it could be a good thing that would annoy the player in some ways, like little rats coming and eating your plants if you don't have any protection on it or anything, also they can just dig their way to your base as they do. ~ Maciej

**IMPORTANT: How much freedom there is?**

**?** Stamina mechanic to limit actions that can be done per day.

> (Stardew Valley vibes?) ~ Maciej

- Removing weeds
- Watering crops to make them grow faster
- Tiling the ground
- Placing crops
etc.

> Maybe getting rid of bugs, creating fertilization of sorts or sprays for protecting your crops. ~ Maciej
>> As I said above, animals that can eat/destroy your crops. ~ Maciej

#### Controls
Game is top-down with no individual pawn control, all actions are done by clicking
on terrain tiles with selected tools.

> I don't know what to do anymore, been thinking a bit differently before I read this, well... Hopefully I helped with some thinking at least. ~ Maciej
>> Fug ~ Михаил
>>> Good luck~! ~ Maciej
